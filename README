Running:
	To run the calculator:
	
		python3 calcx.py

	or if python 3.10 is installed under the 'python' alias:

		python calcx.py

	The compiled assembly code is printed to std output,
	so the following should produce an executable:

		python3 calcx.py >filename


Desc:
	The 'calcx.py' python program is an extension of the
	 'calc.py' program found in the PLY documentation.
	It uses the PLY library to parse plain text in a  
	simple calculator language from std. input.

	While the first assignment was to write an interpretor,
	this version instead compiles the calculator language
	into the coco assembly language.
	
	Operators supported: 	add, subtract, multiply, divide
				integer division, modulus,
				negation.
 
	Parenthesizations are supported

	Lists: Not yet supported
		
		
Grammar: 
	This is my grammar as interpreted by PLY. Of note is that
	I had the strange idea to make all numbers actually single-
	element lists. This caused some problems later on, and there 
	is certainly a more elegant way it could be refactored, but
	it does get the job done.

	Rule 0     S' -> statement
	Rule 1     statement -> NAME = expression
	Rule 2     statement -> expression
	Rule 3     expression -> expression + expression
	Rule 4     expression -> expression - expression
	Rule 5     expression -> expression * expression
	Rule 6     expression -> expression / expression
	Rule 7     expression -> expression % expression
	Rule 8     expression -> - expression
	Rule 9     expression -> ( expression )
	Rule 10    expression -> ( )
	Rule 11    expression -> NUMBER
	Rule 12    expression -> NAME
	Rule 13    expression -> expression / / expression
	Rule 14    expression -> ( list )
	Rule 15    expression -> ( list expression )
	Rule 16    list -> expression ,
	Rule 17    list -> list expression ,
